Core Services

Amazon EC2 provides resizable virtual servers, offering complete control over computing resources and the ability to scale capacity as needed.
Amazon S3 is a durable and highly available object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere, forming the backbone for data lakes, 
static websites, and backups. Understanding the global infrastructure is key; AWS Regions are geographic locations containing multiple, isolated Availability Zones, 
which are physical data centers with redundant power and networking to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for deployed applications.

Security & Identity

 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the core service for controlling secure access to AWS resources by managing users, groups, roles, and their permissions through policies. 
This is underpinned by the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, which delineates that AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, meaning the infrastructure, while the customer is responsible
for security in the cloud, encompassing customer data, IAM configuration, and operating system and network security.

Architecture & Design

AWS Lambda enables serverless computing by allowing code execution without provisioning servers, scaling automatically and charging only for compute time consumed. For network isolation,
Amazon VPC is used to launch AWS resources into a logically defined virtual network, giving the developer control over IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways. Furthermore, a critical operational
distinction is between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance; stopping is akin to shutting down a computer where the instance can be restarted, preserving the root volume, while terminating is equivalent to destruction, where the instance is permanently deleted and its attached storage may be lost unless configured for persistence.


Of course\! Here are some interview questions with answers, syntax, and examples tailored for an AWS Senior Developer role at a company like ITC Infotech. These questions focus on practical application, design patterns, and best practices rather than just definitions.

The questions are designed to test not just *what* you know, but *how* you apply it to solve real-world problems related to scalability, security, and cost-efficiency.

### \#\# 1. Core AWS & Architecture

#### **Question:** You have an application running on EC2 instances in a private subnet that needs to access external APIs over the internet, but you don't want the instances to be directly accessible from the internet. How do you achieve this, and what are the key components involved?

**Answer:**
The standard solution is to use a **NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway**. It allows instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing inbound traffic from being initiated from the internet.

**Key Components:**

1.  **VPC:** Your network foundation.
2.  **Public Subnet:** A subnet with a route to an Internet Gateway. The NAT Gateway will reside here.
3.  **Private Subnet:** Where your EC2 instances are located. This subnet should *not* have a direct route to the Internet Gateway.
4.  **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Attached to the VPC to allow communication with the internet.
5.  **NAT Gateway:** Deployed in the public subnet. It needs an Elastic IP address.
6.  **Route Tables:**
      * The **public route table** (associated with the public subnet) has a route `0.0.0.0/0` pointing to the IGW.
      * The **private route table** (associated with the private subnet) has a route `0.0.0.0/0` pointing to the NAT Gateway.

**Example (AWS CLI Syntax):**

This shows how you'd update the private route table to direct all internet-bound traffic to the NAT Gateway.

```bash
# Assume you have:
# - A route table ID: rtb-012345abcdef
# - A NAT Gateway ID: nat-fedcba543210

aws ec2 create-route \
    --route-table-id rtb-012345abcdef \
    --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 \
    --nat-gateway-id nat-fedcba543210
```

This configuration ensures any EC2 instance in the private subnet can `curl https://api.example.com` but no external user can SSH into or ping that instance directly from the internet.

### \#\# 2. Serverless & Application Modernization

#### **Question:** You have a Lambda function that processes S3 object uploads. Sometimes, the function fails due to transient errors in a downstream service. How would you design a resilient system to handle these failures without losing data?

**Answer:**
The best practice is to configure a **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)** for the Lambda function. When a function fails after all its automatic retries (2 by default for asynchronous invocations), the event payload is sent to the configured DLQ, which is typically an **SQS queue** or an **SNS topic**.

This decouples the failure handling from the main processing logic. You can then have a separate process to inspect the failed messages in the SQS queue, trigger alerts, or attempt to re-process them later.

**Key Concepts:**

  * **Asynchronous Invocation:** S3 triggers Lambda asynchronously, which has built-in retries.
  * **DLQ:** A "catch-all" for events that fail processing completely.
  * **Decoupling:** Prevents failed events from being lost and allows for separate, focused error handling.

**Example (AWS SAM Template Syntax):**

Here's how you'd define a Lambda function and its DLQ using the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM).

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2.0
Resources:
  # SQS Queue to act as the Dead-Letter Queue
  MyFunctionDLQ:
    Type: AWS::SQS::Queue

  # The Lambda Function itself
  MyS3ProcessorFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: nodejs18.x
      # Important: Configure the DeadLetterQueue
      DeadLetterQueue:
        Type: SQS
        TargetArn: !GetAtt MyFunctionDLQ.Arn
      Policies:
        # Policy to allow Lambda to send messages to the SQS queue
        - SQSSendMessagePolicy:
            QueueName: !GetAtt MyFunctionDLQ.QueueName
      Events:
        S3Upload:
          Type: S3
          Properties:
            Bucket: my-upload-bucket
            Events: s3:ObjectCreated:*
```

In this setup, if `MyS3ProcessorFunction` fails after its retries, the original S3 event notification is safely stored in the `MyFunctionDLQ` SQS queue for later analysis.

### \#\# 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### **Question:** You are building a system using CloudFormation. You need to provide a database password to an RDS instance and an API key to a Lambda function. How do you manage these secrets securely without hardcoding them in your template?

**Answer:**
Hardcoding secrets in templates is a major security risk. The correct approach is to use **AWS Secrets Manager** or **AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store** (SecureString type).

1.  **Store the Secret:** Create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager containing the database password or API key.
2.  **Reference the Secret:** Use dynamic references in your CloudFormation template to securely fetch the value at deployment time. CloudFormation resolves these references without ever exposing the secret value in its logs or console.

**Why this is better:**

  * **Security:** Secrets are encrypted at rest and managed outside of your source code.
  * **Lifecycle Management:** Secrets Manager supports automatic secret rotation, which is crucial for database credentials.
  * **IAM Control:** Access to these secrets is tightly controlled via IAM policies.

**Example (CloudFormation Dynamic Reference Syntax):**

Here's how you would reference a secret stored in Secrets Manager for an RDS instance's master password.

```yaml
Resources:
  MyDatabase:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
    Properties:
      DBName: "mydatabase"
      Engine: "mysql"
      MasterUsername: "admin"
      # Dynamic reference to fetch the secret value
      # The 'Secret-Name' is the name of your secret in Secrets Manager
      # The 'password' is the key within the secret's JSON structure
      MasterUserPassword: "{{resolve:secretsmanager:MyDatabaseSecret:SecretString:password}}"
      # ... other properties
```

Similarly, for a Lambda function's environment variable:

```yaml
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: python3.9
      Environment:
        Variables:
          API_KEY: "{{resolve:secretsmanager:MyExternalAPISecret:SecretString:apikey}}"
      # ... other properties
```

### \#\# 4. Security & IAM

#### **Question:** An application in **AWS Account A** needs to read objects from an S3 bucket in **AWS Account B**. What is the most secure way to grant this cross-account access without using long-lived credentials?

**Answer:**
The most secure method is to use an **IAM Role**. This involves creating a trust relationship between the two accounts.

**Steps:**

1.  **In Account B (the resource owner):**

      * Create an **IAM Role** (e.g., `S3ReadRoleFromAccountA`).
      * Attach a policy to this role that grants the necessary permissions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`) to the specific S3 bucket.
      * Configure the role's **Trust Policy** to allow principals (like an EC2 role or a Lambda role) from Account A to assume it.

2.  **In Account A (the application owner):**

      * Grant the IAM identity (e.g., the EC2 instance's role) permission to call the `sts:AssumeRole` action on the role created in Account B.
      * The application code will use the AWS SDK to assume the role in Account B, which provides temporary security credentials. These temporary credentials are then used to access the S3 bucket.

**Example (IAM Trust Policy in Account B):**

This JSON policy is attached to `S3ReadRoleFromAccountA` in Account B. It explicitly trusts the IAM role `AppRoleForEC2` from Account A (`111111111111`).

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/AppRoleForEC2"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

This method avoids static access keys and uses short-lived, automatically rotated credentials, which is the AWS best practice.

### \#\# 5. Scenario-Based Design 🧑‍💻

#### **Question:** Design a highly available and scalable architecture for a web application that receives user-uploaded images, resizes them into thumbnails, and serves both the original and the thumbnail images to users with low latency.

**Answer:**
This is a classic serverless design pattern that leverages managed services for scalability and cost-efficiency.

**Architecture Components:**

1.  **User Upload:** Users upload images directly to an **S3 Bucket** (`originals-bucket`), preferably using S3 pre-signed URLs generated by the backend. This offloads the upload traffic from our servers.
2.  **Trigger:** Configure **S3 Event Notifications** on `originals-bucket`. For every new object created (`s3:ObjectCreated:*`), it will trigger a **Lambda Function**.
3.  **Processing:**
      * The **Lambda function** receives the S3 event, downloads the original image, resizes it into a thumbnail (using a library like `sharp` for Node.js or `Pillow` for Python), and uploads the thumbnail to a different S3 bucket (`thumbnails-bucket`).
      * To handle processing failures, the Lambda should be configured with a **DLQ (SQS queue)**.
4.  **Metadata (Optional but recommended):** A **DynamoDB** table can store metadata about the images, such as the original key, thumbnail key, upload time, status, etc. The Lambda function would update this table.
5.  **Content Delivery:** Use **Amazon CloudFront** as a CDN, with two origins pointing to the `originals-bucket` and `thumbnails-bucket`. This caches the images at edge locations globally, drastically reducing latency for end-users. It also reduces S3 data transfer costs.

**Flow:**
`User -> (gets pre-signed URL) -> S3 Upload -> S3 Event -> Lambda -> S3 (thumbnail) -> CloudFront -> End User`

**Why this design is good:**

  * **Scalable:** S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB all scale automatically. You don't manage any servers.
  * **Highly Available:** These are managed AWS services with high built-in availability and redundancy.
  * **Cost-Effective:** You only pay for the compute time used by Lambda, the storage in S3/DynamoDB, and the data transfer through CloudFront (pay-as-you-go).
  * **Decoupled:** The upload, processing, and delivery steps are fully decoupled, making the system resilient.


When to Use Merge vs. Rebase

Use Merge when:

· You are merging a feature branch into the main branch (e.g., main or develop). This preserves the exact history of your development process, which can be useful.
· The branch is public and shared with other developers. Merging is safe.
· You want a clear record of when a specific feature was integrated.

Use Rebase when:

· You are working on a local feature branch and want to incorporate the latest changes from main to keep your branch up-to-date. This is the most common use case.
  · Instead of git merge main, do git rebase main. This puts your neat feature work on top of the latest main code, avoiding a merge commit.
· You want to clean up and simplify your local commit history
