👉 “ASCENDERS-BASL”

Why this works:

* Uses all the letters in order.
* **ASCENDERS** is already a real word (part of typography, also means “rising upward”).
* Then add **BASL** at the end (you can remember it as **Bulkhead, API, Strangler, Leader**).

So the full acronym:

* **A**PI Gateway
* **S**ervice Registry
* **C**ircuit Breaker
* **E**vent (from CQRS/Events combo to make it smoother)
* **N** (linker letter to make word readable)
* **D**atabase per Service
* **E**xternalized Config
* **R**etry
* **S**idecar

Then **BASL** for the rest.

✅ Final single word: **ASCENDERSBASL**
Easy to pronounce: *“Ah-sen-ders-Bas-el”*
Meaning: It suggests *rising up* → just like microservices scaling and improving.


👍. You want **memory tricks (mnemonics)** to quickly learn and recall these **microservice design patterns** with their meaning. Let’s build a simple **story-based trick** where each pattern connects like a chain.

### 🎯 Trick to Remember Microservice Design Patterns

Imagine you’re running a **big city** where every **building = microservice**.
To keep the city running smoothly, you apply these patterns:

---

1. **API Gateway 🌍**
   🚪 *Think of it as the **main gate of the city*** where all visitors come first, get verified, and then routed inside.
   → Centralized request handling, authentication, routing.

2. **Service Registry 📌**
   🗺️ *Every building is listed on a city map with its address.*
   → Helps services auto-discover each other.

3. **Circuit Breaker ⚡**
   🚦 *Like a fuse in your house — if one light shorts, it cuts off to prevent a fire.*
   → Stops cascading failures.

4. **Saga 🔄**
   🧾 *A chain of shops handling parts of a transaction (buy → ship → bill).* If one fails, it compensates.
   → Manages distributed transactions.

5. **CQRS 📊**
   🏪 *One shop only takes orders (writes), another shop only delivers info (reads).*
   → Splits read/write for performance.

6. **Bulkhead 🛑**
   🚢 *Like compartments in a ship — if one floods, the rest stay safe.*
   → Contain failures, avoid system-wide crash.

7. **Sidecar 🚗**
   🛵 *A small scooter attached to a car, helping with monitoring and security.*
   → Attach helper services.

8. **API Composition 🔗**
   🧩 *Combining different small services into a big service like assembling Lego pieces.*
   → Aggregate microservices into richer APIs.

9. **Event-Driven Architecture 📢**
   📯 *Like loudspeakers announcing events — everyone who cares listens.*
   → Services communicate via events.

10. **Database per Service 💽**
    🏦 *Each shop in the city has its own cash register.*
    → Independent databases, no conflicts.

11. **Retry 🔁**
    📞 *If a phone call fails, you redial until it connects.*
    → Auto-retry failed requests.

12. **Externalized Configuration ⚙️**
    📂 *Keep all city rules in a central rulebook outside the buildings.*
    → Store configs separately for easy updates.

13. **Strangler Fig 🌱**
    🌳 *A new tree grows around an old one, replacing it bit by bit.*
    → Modernize legacy systems gradually.

14. **Leader Election 👑**
    🧑‍⚖️ *Citizens vote for a mayor to coordinate city decisions.*
    → Assign a leader for coordination.

### 🧠 Super-Mnemonic Story

"At the **Gateway** 🌍, I check the **Registry** 📌 to find my way. If lights fail, a **Circuit Breaker** ⚡ saves me.
I run a **Saga** 🔄 across shops, using **CQRS** 📊 for order and info.
A **Bulkhead** 🛑 ship saves the city, with a **Sidecar** 🚗 helper.
I use **API Composition** 🔗 Lego to build features, and follow **Events** 📢 like city announcements.
Each shop keeps its own **Database** 💽. If calls fail, I **Retry** 🔁.
Configs are in a **Rulebook** ⚙️, old systems replaced by a **Strangler Fig** 🌱.
Finally, a **Leader** 👑 keeps order.
