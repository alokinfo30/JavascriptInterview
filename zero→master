Project flow you will use every time (8-step checklist)

1. Goal: 1-sentence. e.g. “Simple Todo app with user auth and CRUD.”
2. User stories (Jira tickets): write 5 tickets minimum. Example: As a user, I want to sign up, so I can save my todos.
3. Data model: list entities and fields.
4. API contract: endpoints, method, sample request/response.
5. Wireframe: rough sketch for list, add, edit.
6. Dev tasks: break each story into sub-tasks, assign branches like feature/T123-auth.
7. CI & test: lint, unit tests, integration tests, build stage.
8. Deploy & monitor: one environment first (staging), then production.


Perfect. Let’s walk through each 8-step checklist item using a Todo App with Authentication as an example. I’ll include statements, code snippets, syntax, and examples so you can copy/adapt for any project.


---

1. Goal

Statement:
“Build a simple Todo application with authentication, where users can sign up, log in, and manage their todos (create, read, update, delete).”


---

2. User Stories (Jira tickets)

Write them as Jira-style tickets:

1. T101 - User Registration
As a user, I want to sign up with email and password so I can create my account.


2. T102 - User Login
As a user, I want to log in with email and password so I can access my todos securely.


3. T103 - Create Todo
As a logged-in user, I want to add a new todo so I can keep track of tasks.


4. T104 - View Todos
As a logged-in user, I want to see all my todos so I can manage them.


5. T105 - Update & Delete Todo
As a logged-in user, I want to edit or delete my todo so I can keep my list up to date.

3. Data Model

Entities in MongoDB (Mongoose schema example):

User Model (src/models/User.ts)

import { Schema, model } from "mongoose";
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true }
}, { timestamps: true });

// hash password before save
UserSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
  if (!this.isModified("password")) return next();
  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 10);
  next();
});

export default model("User", UserSchema);

Todo Model (src/models/Todo.ts)

import { Schema, model } from "mongoose";

const TodoSchema = new Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  completed: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User", required: true }
}, { timestamps: true });

export default model("Todo", TodoSchema);


---

4. API Contract

Auth

POST /api/auth/signup
Request:

{ "email": "test@example.com", "password": "secret123" }

Response:

{ "message": "User created successfully" }

POST /api/auth/login
Request:

{ "email": "test@example.com", "password": "secret123" }

Response:

{ "token": "JWT_TOKEN_STRING" }


Todos

GET /api/todos
Headers: Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN
Response:

[
  { "_id": "1", "title": "Learn Node", "completed": false },
  { "_id": "2", "title": "Learn React", "completed": true }
]

POST /api/todos
Request:

{ "title": "New Todo" }

Response:

{ "_id": "3", "title": "New Todo", "completed": false }

PUT /api/todos/:id
Request:

{ "completed": true }

Response:

{ "_id": "3", "title": "New Todo", "completed": true }

DELETE /api/todos/:id
Response:

{ "message": "Todo deleted" }



---

5. Wireframe

(Rough ASCII sketch, real one can be in Figma)

+-----------------------+
|      Login Page       |
| Email: [___________]  |
| Pass:  [___________]  |
| [Login]  [Signup]     |
+-----------------------+

+-----------------------+
|      Todo List        |
|  [ Add new todo  + ]  |
|                       |
|  [ ] Learn Node       |
|  [x] Learn React      |
|  (Edit)   (Delete)    |
+-----------------------+


---

6. Dev Tasks & Branching

Break Jira stories into dev subtasks:

T101 User Registration

Create User model

Add signup API

Hash passwords

Branch: feature/T101-signup


T102 User Login

Add login API

Generate JWT token

Branch: feature/T102-login


T103 Create Todo

Create Todo model

Add POST /todos

Branch: feature/T103-add-todo


T104 View Todos

Add GET /todos

Branch: feature/T104-view-todos


T105 Update/Delete

Add PUT /todos/:id

Add DELETE /todos/:id

Branch: feature/T105-update-delete




---

7. CI & Test

Example Test (Jest + Supertest)

import request from "supertest";
import app from "../src/app";

describe("Todo API", () => {
  it("should return 401 if no token", async () => {
    const res = await request(app).get("/api/todos");
    expect(res.status).toBe(401);
  });
});

Jenkinsfile (snippet)

pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Install') { steps { sh 'npm ci' } }
    stage('Lint') { steps { sh 'npm run lint' } }
    stage('Test') { steps { sh 'npm test -- --coverage' } }
    stage('Build') { steps { sh 'npm run build' } }
  }
}


---

8. Deploy & Monitor

Docker Compose (local dev)

version: "3.9"
services:
  api:
    build: ./todo-api
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    env_file:
      - ./todo-api/.env
  web:
    build: ./todo-web
    ports:
      - "3000:80"

AWS Deployment (steps)

1. Push Docker images to ECR.


2. Deploy backend container to ECS Fargate or EC2.


3. Host frontend on S3 + CloudFront.


4. Logs → CloudWatch.


5. Monitoring → create alarm for 5xx errors.

✅ This checklist now has statements + code + syntax + examples for each step.
Would you like me to turn this into a full repo scaffold (with files ready to run) so you can git clone, run, and practice from day one?
